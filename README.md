I've done Bash scripting in the past but I've never learned Bash scripting completely and it has always been a goal of mine to deepen my understanding of automation and system administration. 
While I’ve had some experience with Linux commands before, I felt this was the next level. 
It’s been a cool and quick learning process, and I know I’ll be using this knowledge in the near future to streamline tasks and improve my efficiency in tech.
